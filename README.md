**TL;DR Summary:** a [mac os x specific] shell script to automatically join Wi-Fi/AirPort networks


## Details ##

I came across this question on [AskDifferent] and it reminded me that I had dealt with the same problem with one of my Macs awhile ago.

   [AskDifferent]: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/89616/osx-wont-automatically-connect-to-wifi

I dug out the shell script that I had written to "solve" the problem, and then (of course) decided to re-write it, even though I'm not having the problem now.

The idea is very simple:

* use the `airport` command<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="#fn-1">[1]</a> to check to see if we are connected to a Wi-Fi network:

	* If we are connected to a Wi-Fi network already, exit

	* If we are *not* connected to a Wi-Fi network, scan for local available networks.


* Compare available SSIDs against a list of "known SSIDs" (which you have to add to the script):
	* if none are available, exit
	* if one is available, try to join it using the `networksetup` command.

That's pretty much it.

## launchd ##

This script can be called two ways:

1.	directly through the command line.
2.	via `launchd` which will automatically run it 

Put the `airport-autojoin.sh` in /usr/local/bin/ 
and then install [com.tjluoma.on-network-change.plist] to `/Library/LaunchDaemons` (which will make sure that it is run as `root`).

[com.tjluoma.on-network-change.plist]: https://github.com/tjluoma/airport-autojoin/blob/master/com.tjluoma.on-network-change.plist

## Authentication ##

The shell script needs to run as root in order to run the `networksetup` command. If you run it via `launchd` as recommended above it will be run as root.

The firs time you run this script, you may be asked to authenticate with a message like this:

<img src='SecurityAgent-434x256.jpg' width=434 height=256 border=0 alt='Security Agent Prompt' />

If so, just enter your login name and password.

		<p> You know about the `airport` command, right? It's located at /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport although I always link it to /usr/local/bin/airport as soon as I setup a new Mac.
